### Instructions:
Create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:
1.  Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2.  Choose a color.
3.  Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.


Your primary task is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

### Optional Features Added:
* Click and drag to paint
* Double-click to remove color
* Save art to PNG file
